Here's a README file for your Mastodon posts to diary script:

---

# MastBlog

This script fetches all public posts from a Mastodon user and formats them into a diary-style HTML document. It is designed to be run from the command line and requires Python with several packages.

## Features

- Fetches user posts from a Mastodon instance.
- Processes and formats posts that start with `#Diary`.
- Generates an HTML file with formatted diary entries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library
- `python-dotenv` library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or save the script to a file (e.g., `mastodon_user_info.py`).

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the same directory as the script. This file should contain the following environment variables:

    ```ini
    MASTODON_URL=https://mastodon.example.com
    OUTPUT_FILE=posts.html
    ```

    - `MASTODON_URL`: The URL of the Mastodon instance. For example, `https://mastodon.social`.
    - `OUTPUT_FILE`: The name of the output HTML file where the diary will be saved.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line with the following options:

```bash
python mastodon_user_info.py [url] [--output output_file]
```

### Arguments

- `url` (optional): The URL of the Mastodon profile to fetch posts from. If not provided, the URL specified in the `.env` file will be used.
- `--output` (optional): The name of the output HTML file. Defaults to `posts.html` if not specified.

### Example

To fetch posts from `@example` on `https://mastodon.example.com` and save them to `diary.html`, you can run:

```bash
python mastodon_user_info.py https://mastodon.example.com/@example --output diary.html
```

## Notes

- Only posts that start with `#Diary` will be included in the output.
- Replies and posts with empty content are excluded.
- The script handles date and time formatting and includes basic error handling for network issues and unexpected responses.

## Troubleshooting

- **Network Errors**: Ensure that the Mastodon instance URL is correct and accessible.
- **Invalid Date/Time**: If date or time formatting fails, it may be due to an unexpected date format in the post data.
- **Unexpected Response Format**: Verify that the Mastodon API response structure matches expectations.
